Introduction

Scope
-----

The MULTIPLY project will “develop a new platform for joint and consistent retrieval of Copernicus
SENTINEL data and beyond”.
This document presents the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) of the MULTIPLY
project. The ATBD aims at providing a detailed description of the algorithms implemented in the
different processing chains, including a scientific background, a justification for each implemented
algorithm and the parameterisation used in the project.
This ATBD is written through successive increments. This initial version (v1) deals with the
coarse resolution data in general. The second version focus on the activities regarding the high-
resolution data and a last version (v3) will be released at the end of the project. The ATBD-v3 will be
the final version of the document.
